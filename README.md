# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

### Testing the API
To manually test the API, run:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

For /delivery/{deliveryId} requests a deliveryId of 1 can be used for successful requests


### Other notes
The fixed rate for the delivery service is hard coded to 2$ in ./service/DeliveryService.js

The robot is always assumed to be available but can be changed in ./service/RobotService.js example object
